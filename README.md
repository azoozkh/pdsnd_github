### Exploring US Bike Share Data 



### Datasets   
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. The data files contain the same core six columns:
Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)





### Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to the bike share systems of three major cities â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. I wrote code to import the data and compute descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal.


### Files
I used data provided by Motivate, a national bike share system provider. In order to run the program, the following files are needed.

chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

### Credits
The program was written using:
Python 3
NumPy and Pandas were installed using Anaconda
